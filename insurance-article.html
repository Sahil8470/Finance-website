                    <h1>What is Insurance?</h1>

                    <p>Insurance is a legal contract between two parties. One is the insurance company and the other is
                        the individual. </p>
                    <p>In the contract, the insurance company promises to compensate the insurer for the financial
                        losses suffered due to contingencies. The compensation will be according to the previously
                        agreed upon terms. In return, the insurer will pay a premium to the company.</p>
                    <p>When you buy insurance, you simply transfer the risk to the insurance company. You can buy
                        insurance for different types of risks, ranging from risk to your life to risk to vehicles.</p>

                        <h2 class="subheadings">How does insurance work? </h2>

                        <p>Insurance works on the grounds of risk pooling. If you buy a policy from an insurance company
                            for a certain amount and specific period, it is important that you make the regular payments
                            for the same. </p>
                        <p>The company will collect this premium from all customers and will pool the money to make up
                            for the losses one insurer suffered. Whenever you make a claim, the insurance company will
                            pool the resources from the total premiums collected and will compensate you for the same.
                        </p>
                        <p> If you do not make a claim, there is no benefit that is paid to you. You can find unique
                            products that have an element of savings attached to them.</p>

                        <!-- Education Insurance -->

                        <h5 class="subheadings">4. Education Insurance</h5>
                        <p>Education insurance is a policy that offers protection as well as an opportunity for saving
                            money to ensure a secure future for your child. It makes sure that your child receives the
                            education he/she desires with a lump-sum payout at maturity or when any unfortunate event
                            occurs to you.</p>
                        <p>One of the major benefits is the financial cover to the child in case of the death of a
                            parent. The insured child gets at least 100% of the sum insured amount. The policy continues
                            to provide for higher education expenses, as the maturity amount is approximately 10 times
                            the premium cost. </p>

                        <h5 class="insurance-types">What are the benefits of education insurance?</h5>
                        <ul>  
                        <h6 class="insurance-types">I. Protection In Case of Unforeseen Circumstances</h6>
                        <p> One of the major benefits is the financial cover to the child in case of the death of a
                            parent.
                            The insured child gets at least 100% of the sum insured amount. The policy continues to
                            provide
                            for higher education expenses, as the maturity amount is approximately 10 times the premium
                            cost.</p>

                        <h6 class="insurance-types">II. Maturity Benefit to Meet College Expenses</h6>
                        <p> As you can see, the cost of education is soaring at 10%, which is much higher than the
                            economic
                            inflation. The cost of a B.tech course has been hiked to Rs. 2 lakhs from Rs. 90,000.
                            Therefore,
                            it is no less than a necessity to invest in a child-saving plan that would offer sufficient
                            funds to help your child meet all the key educational milestones in his life.</p>

                        <h6 class="insurance-types">III. Options to Choose Add-ons/ Riders</h6>
                        <p>Even when you have bought the best saving plan for a child, you should enhance it further
                            with
                            rider benefits. You can choose a child plan that offers a waiver of the premium you have
                            paid
                            during the policy term if anything untoward happens to the policyholderâ€”other rider benefits
                            like personal accident insurance rider benefit cover-up for severe accidental injuries and
                            accidental deaths.</p>

                        <h6 class="insurance-types">IV. Fund Your Child's School Fees</h6>
                        <p>In case the parent who has purchased the child's education plan dies. The insurance company
                            immediately pays a percentage of the sum assured immediately, and a certain percentage is
                            paid
                            annually until the end of the policy term. The amount paid is sufficient to pay off your
                            child's
                            school fees even in your absence.</p>

                        <h6 class="insurance-types">V. Avoid Loss of Capital</h6>
                        <p> Due to market fluctuations, even your investment returns can vary. A dynamic fund allocation
                            strategy needs to be adopted to make the most of the amount invested and save it from
                            capital
                            loss. You can also opt for a Systematic Transfer Plan or STP and fund selection to plan your
                            investments according to expected returns and the amount that will help meet the different
                            milestones. With STP, you can switch to a different fund unit when the market is volatile.
                        </p>
                        <h6 class="insurance-types">VI. Avail Income Tax Benefits</h6>
                        <p> The premium paid on a child education plan is eligible for tax deduction under Section 80 C,
                            up
                            to a limit of Rs. 1.5 lakh in a year. You can also avail of tax benefits on the maturity
                            amount

                        <p>
                            So, there were the key benefits that a child education plan can offer apart from being a

                        <!-- Home Insurance -->

                        <h5 class="subheadings">5. Home insurance</h5>
                        <p>Homeowners insurance is a package policy. This means that it covers both damage to property
                            and liability or legal responsibility for any injuries and property damage policyholders or
                            their families cause to other people. This includes damage caused by household pets.</p>

                        <p>Damage caused by most disasters is covered but there are exceptions. Standard homeowners
                            policies do not cover flooding, earthquakes or poor maintenance. Flood coverage is provided
                            by the federal governmentâ€™s National Flood Insurance Program, although it is purchased from
                            an insurance agent. Earthquake coverage is available either in the form of an endorsement or
                            as a separate policy. Most maintenance related problems are the homeownersâ€™ responsibility.
                        </p>

                        <p>A standard homeowners insurance policy includes four essential types of coverage. They
                            include:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <h6 class="insurance-types">I. Coverage for the structure of the home</h6>
                            <p> This part of a policy pays to repair or rebuild a home if it is damaged or destroyed by
                                fire, hurricane, hail, lightning or other disaster listed in the policy. It will not pay
                                for
                                damage caused by a flood, earthquake or routine wear and tear. Most standard policies
                                also
                                cover structures that are not attached to a house such as a garage, tool shed or gazebo.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h6 class="insurance-types">II. Coverage for personal belongings</h6>
                            <p> Furniture, clothes, sports equipment and other personal items are covered if they are
                                stolen
                                or destroyed by fire, hurricane or other insured disaster. Most companies provide
                                coverage
                                for 50 to 70 percent of the amount of insurance on the structure of a home. This part of
                                the
                                policy includes off-premises coverage. This means that belongings are covered anywhere
                                in
                                the world, unless the policyholder has decided against off-premises coverage. Expensive
                                items like jewelry, furs and silverware are covered, but there are usually dollar limits
                                if
                                they are stolen. To insure these items to their full value, individuals can purchase a
                                special personal property endorsement or floater and insure the item for its appraised
                                value.</p>

                            <p>Trees, plants and scrubs are also covered under standard homeowners insuranceâ€”generally
                                up to about $500 per item. Perils covered are theft, fire, lightning, explosion,
                                vandalism, riot and even falling aircraft. They are not covered for damage by wind or
                                disease.</p>

                            <p> Liability covers against lawsuits for bodily injury or property damage that
                                policyholders or
                                family members cause to other people. It also pays for damage caused by pets. The
                                liability
                                portion of the policy pays for both the cost of defending the policyholder in court and
                                any
                                court awardsâ€”up to the limit of the policy. Coverage is not just in the home but extends
                                to
                                anywhere in the world. Liability limits generally start at about $100,000. An umbrella
                                or
                                excess liability policy, which provides broader coverage, including claims for libel and
                                slander, as well as higher liability limits, can be added to the policy.</p>

                            <h6 class="insurance-types">IV. Additional living expenses</h6>
                            <p>This pays the additional costs of living away from home if a house is inhabitable due to
                                damage from a fire, storm or other insured disaster. It covers hotel bills, restaurant
                                meals
                                and other living expenses incurred while the home is being rebuilt. Coverage for
