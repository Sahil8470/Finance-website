                    <h1>Investments in India</h1>
                    <p>Investing is allocating money towards assets in the hope of making your future better. Investments are made with the view of earning returns, which grows your amount invested to a higher sum.</p>
                            
                    <!-- Why to invest -->
                    <h3 class="subheadings">Why do people Invest?</h3>
                    <p>There are varying reasons why people invest. Let us look at a few:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Financial security:</strong> People want to be financially secure and this is why they need to have extra money. They are
                        able to protect themselves financially against whatever financial hardship that might strike
                        them. An example could be a costly life event such as a major health crisis or home
                        destruction by a cyclone or fire. Having an investment ensures that you are financially
                        secured to meet such unforeseen events.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Financial independence:</strong> Your investment enables you to be independent and not rely on the money of others in any
                        event of financial hardship. It ensures that you have enough money to pay for your needs and
                        wants for the rest of your life without having to rely on someone else or having to work in
                        your old age.</li>

                        <li><strong>Build your wealth:</strong> People invest with the view to build their wealth. This means that they save and then invest
                        their savings over time. In this process, the proceeds from the investments, whether they are
                        dividends or interest earned, can be reinvested into the same financial instrument or even
                        something else. This way you too can start investing and continue building your wealth.</li>

                        <li><strong>Attain your goals:</strong> Some people set specific goals in life and invest to achieve those goals. For example, if it is
                        your dream to buy a house or a new car or take a trip around the world, the goal you set
                        would be your motivation to invest. It is important that you list down your goals and how
                        much money you need to achieve that goal. Your goals could be short term, medium or long
                        term in nature. Investing your money according to your goals will enable you to grow your
                        money and achieve your goals quickly without you having to work all your life.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!-- Impact of Inflation and the Importance of Investing -->
                    <h3 class="subheadings">Impact of Inflation and the Importance of Investing</h3>
                    <p>Inflation, in simple terms, is a surge in the price of materials and services. It decreases the worth of your money and reduces your purchasing power. 
                    When there is a rise in the inflation rate, you buy fewer things with the same amount of money. You have no control over the inflation rate.</p>      

                    <p> If you are to stay ahead of inflation, you need to have more money to purchase the extent of the goods you intend to in the future with the money you have today.
                     But, money doesn't grow on its own. If your money has to grow, then it has to earn returns. To earn returns, you need to invest.</p>

                     <p>Therefore, making investments is necessary to tackle inflation. Inflation at the rate of 8% means that you need 8% more money than what you have to purchase the same item next year.
                     Here's how inflation at 8% reduces the worth of Rs 1 lakh over eight years:</p>

                    <h3 class="subheadings">Types of Investments</h3>
                    <p>You have numerous investment options to choose from. You have to assess your requirements and risk profile before deciding to invest in any particular investment option. Investments are broadly divided into active and passive.</p>
                    <p> Active investment requires you to dynamically change assets in your portfolio, depending on the market and economic developments. You need to have enough time and knowledge of investments to indulge yourself in active investments. Equity investments are the best example of active investments.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, passive investments do not require you to be hands-on with your investments. You invest your money and stay invested for a certain duration of time. It is also referred to as the buy-and-hold strategy of investment. This strategy of investment is advisable for those who can’t spare time to manage their investments.</p>
                    <p>The following table shows the major differences between active and passive investments:</p>

                    <!-- Popular Investment Options in India -->
                    <h3 class="subheadings">Popular Investment Options in India</h3>
                    <p>You have numerous investment options to choose from. However, you have to ensure that you are investing in only those options that fall under your risk tolerance and serve your requirements.</p>

                    <h5 class="subheadings">1. Direct Equity</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Direct equity, commonly referred to as investing in stocks, is probably the most potent investment vehicle. </li>
                        <li>When you buy a company’s stock, you buy partial ownership of that company. You directly invest in the company’s growth and development.</li>
                        <li>You need to have enough time and possess the market knowledge to benefit from your investment. If not, then investing in direct equity is as good as speculation.</li>
                        <li>Stocks are offered publicly listed companies through the recognised stock exchanges and can be bought by any investor who has Demat account and undergone KYC verification.</li>
                        <li>Stocks are ideal for long-term investments. You have to actively manage your investments as various economic and business factors influence stocks. Also, you need to understand that the returns are not guaranteed and be willing to assume the associated risks.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <!-- Give some link to connect this topic to stocks page -->

                    <h5 class="subheadings">2. Mutual Funds</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mutual funds have been around for the past few decades, and are gaining popularity amongst millennials.</li>
                        <li>A mutual fund pools investment from various individual and institutional investors who have a common investment objective. The pooled sum is managed by a finance professional called the fund manager, who invests in securities and assets to generate optimum returns for investors.</li>
                        <li>Mutual funds are broadly divided into equity, debt and hybrid funds.</li>
                        <li>Equity mutual funds invest in stocks and equity-related instruments, while debt mutual funds invest in bonds and papers. Hybrid funds invest across equity and debt instruments</li>
                        <li>Mutual funds are flexible investment vehicles, in which you can begin and stop investing as per your convenience.</li>
                        <li>Any individual may consider investing in mutual funds. You don’t need to have time or knowledge to invest in mutual funds as the fund manager takes care of portfolio constitution, and you only have to invest.</li>
                        <li>However, it is advisable to invest in only those funds whose risk levels and objectives match yours. The returns are not guaranteed as they are dependent entirely on the market movements. Note that past performance of a fund does not indicate future returns.</li>   
                    </ul>

                    <h5 class="subheadings">3. Fixed Deposits</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed deposits are an investment option offered by banks and financial institutions under which you deposit a lump sum for a fixed period and earn a predetermined rate of interest.</li>
                        <li>Unlike mutual funds and stocks, fixed deposits offer complete capital protection as well as guaranteed returns. However, you compromise on the returns as they remain the same.</li>
                        <li>Fixed deposits are ideal for the conservative investor. The interest offered by fixed deposits change as per the economic conditions and are decided by the banks depending on the RBI's policy review decisions.</li>
                        <li>Fixed deposits are typically locked-in investments, but investors are often allowed to avail loans or overdraft facilities against them. There is also a tax-saving variant of fixed deposit, which comes with a lock-in of 5 years.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5 class="subheadings">4. Recurring Deposits</h5>
                    <ul>
