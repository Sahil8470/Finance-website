                            <p>In finance, stock (also capital stock) consists of all of the shares into which ownership of a corporation or company is divided</p>

                            <p>Stocks are bought and sold predominantly on stock exchanges, though there can be private sales as well, and they are the foundation of nearly every portfolio</p>

                                    <li>Capital appreciation, which occurs when a stock rises in price</li>
                                    <li>Dividend payments, which come when the company distributes some of its earnings to stockholders</li>

                                <p>There are two main kinds of stocks, common stock and preferred stock. </p>

                                <h5 class="Types">1. Common stock</h5>
                                Common stock entitles owners to vote at shareholder meetings and receive dividends.
                                <p>Most stock that people invest in is common stock. Common stock represents partial ownership in a company, with shareholders getting the right to receive a proportional share of the value of any remaining assets if the company gets dissolved.</p>

                                
                                <h5 class="Types">2. Preferred stock</h5>
                                <p>Preferred stockholders usually don’t have voting rights but they receive dividend payments before common stockholders do, and have priority over common stockholders if the company goes bankrupt and its assets are liquidated. </p>

                            <p>Another way to categorize stocks is by the size of the company, as shown in its market capitalization. There are large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks. Shares in very small companies are sometimes called “microcap” stocks. The very lowest priced stocks are known as “penny stocks.” These companies may have little or no earnings. Penny stocks do not pay dividends and are highly speculative.</p>

                                <h3 class="stock-risks">What are the benefits and risks of stocks?</h3>

                               <ul>
                                    <li>Stocks offer investors the greatest potential for growth (capital appreciation) over the long haul. Investors willing to stick with stocks over long periods of time, say 15 years, generally have been rewarded with strong, positive returns.</li>
                                    <li>But stock prices move down as well as up. There’s no guarantee that the company whose stock you hold will grow and do well, so you can lose money you invest in stocks.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>If a company goes bankrupt and its assets are liquidated, common stockholders are the last in line to share in the proceeds. The company’s bondholders will be paid first, then holders of preferred stock. If you are a common stockholder, you get whatever is left, which may be nothing.</li>                                           
                                 
                                    <li>Stocks usually are one part of an investor’s holdings. If you are young and saving for a long-term goal such as retirement, you may want to hold more stocks than bonds. Investors nearing or in retirement may want to hold more bonds than stocks.</li>
                                    <li>The risks of stock holdings can be offset in part by investing in a number of different stocks. Investing in other kinds of assets that are not stocks, such as bonds, is another way to offset some of the risks of owning stocks.</li>

                               </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Some companies allow you to buy or sell their stock directly through them without using a broker. This saves on commissions, but you may have to pay other fees to the plan, including if you transfer shares to a broker to sell them. Some companies limit direct stock plans to employees of the company or existing shareholders. Some require minimum amounts for purchases or account levels.</li>
                                    <li>Direct stock plans usually will not allow you to buy or sell shares at a specific market price or at a specific time. Instead, the company will buy or sell shares for the plan at set times — such as daily, weekly, or monthly — and at an average market price. Depending on the plan, you may be able to automate your purchases and have the cost deducted automatically from your savings account.</li>                
                                </ul>
